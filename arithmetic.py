#mathematical operations in python! Time to do some math :)

#addition

computer_science_students = 21
business_students = 17
total_students = computer_science_students + business_students
print("business + computer science students", total_students)

#when in orange, LITERALLY print the words in the brackets
#3 variables in total

#subtraction

highest_score = 100
my_score = 57
difference = highest_score - my_score
print("highest score - my score = ", difference)

#multiplication

siblings = 4
number_of_children_per_sibling = 3
family_size = siblings * number_of_children_per_sibling
print("total family size = ", family_size)

# * = multiply in python, not x

#division

money_available = 1000000
cost_per_ice_cream = 10
total_ice_cream_possible_to_buy = money_available / cost_per_ice_cream
print("You can buy = ", total_ice_cream_possible_to_buy, "ice cream")

# / = divide in python, think of it as a fraction

#modulus operator - gives you the remained left over after a division

x = 17
y = 5
remainder_after_division = x % y
print("Remainder after the division = ", remainder_after_division)

# % = the remainder of the division, it's the modulus operator, not division
